# Medical-Cost-Insurance---Simple-Linear-Regression

Note: The Dataset and Algorithms, I have used here are purely for my understanding purpose, as I'm beginner to Machine Learning Algorithms. 
The reason of uploading this is because, I thought this would be helpful to those who are beginners in ML World !!!!


The aim is to predict the expenses for the treatment of the patients in the hospital.
The dataset consists of;
       a. Age
       b. BMI
       c. Sex
       d. No. of Children
       e. Smoker or Not
       f. Region (Patient's Residence)
       g. Total expenses
    
I have used linear regression algorithm to predict the total expenses. Overall, accuracy is 76.68% which is somewhat good model of fit.


Feel Free to point out mistakes in my model and also gives suggestions to improve the model as well as my knowledge in ML...!!
