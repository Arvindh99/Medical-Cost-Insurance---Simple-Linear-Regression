# Medical Cost Insurance - Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains a simple linear regression model to predict the expenses for the treatment of patients in a hospital. The dataset used in this project consists of various factors that might affect the expenses, including age, BMI, sex, number of children, smoker status, region of residence, and the total expenses.

### Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:

       1. Age: Age of the patient
       2. BMI: Body Mass Index of the patient
       3. Sex: Gender of the patient
       4. No. of Children: Number of children the patient has
       5. Smoker: Smoker or non-smoker
       6. Region: Residence region of the patient
       7. Total Expenses: Total expenses for the patient's treatment

### Objective

The objective of this project is to build a simple linear regression model that can predict the total expenses based on the given features. This model can be useful for estimating the costs for medical treatment and insurance purposes.

### Model Performance

The linear regression model achieved an accuracy of 76.68% in predicting the total expenses. As a beginner in machine learning algorithms, this project serves as a learning exercise and provides insights into the application of linear regression for predicting medical costs.

### Suggestions and Contributions

As a beginner, I acknowledge that there might be mistakes in the model or opportunities for improvement. I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to enhance the model or my understanding of machine learning. Please feel free to provide your insights and recommendations.

### Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the contributors and maintainers of the datasets used in this project. Additionally, I extend my appreciation to the machine learning community for their valuable resources and tutorials that have helped me learn and apply these concepts.

Please note that this project and the algorithms used are for educational purposes and may not represent a production-level solution.
